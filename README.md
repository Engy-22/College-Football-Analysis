For the most part, this uses the cfbscrapR package to pull EPA data -- thanks @msubbaiah1!

The Create EPA Charts script has everything you need to create a simple offense EPA per play x defense EPA per play chart. All you'll need to do is change the local directory for your logo files. 

The EPA 2019 script has many more options for cleaning and analyzing the cfbscrapR EPA data.
