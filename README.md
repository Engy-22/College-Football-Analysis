This repo contains scripts and markdown files to analyze college football using EPA data from [cfbscrapR](https://github.com/meysubb/cfbscrapR). It includes analyses of how to measure explosiveness using EPA, how players switch positions, the relationship between talent and production at the team and individual levels, and how to clean and create overall EPA team summary data.
